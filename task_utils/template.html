<h1>Big(O) Report for searching algorithms</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The tests were executed for {{algorithms}} algorithms. Each test was performed for {{runs_number}} times.</p>
<p>The search was executed for two cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Patterns these are present in both texts</li>
    <li>Patterns these are present neither in the first texts nor in the second one</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are presented in the table below and on the plot.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Table with average time</h3>
<p>The table with average time of calculation for each algorithm per pattern length and pattern presence:</p>
{{ my_table }}
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>Time dependencies on pattern length for each algorithm:</p>
<img src='plot.svg' width="1200">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Based on the results, the following conclusions can be made:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Algorithm Booyer-Moore Search is the fastest for both texts.</li>
    <li>Algorithm Rabin-Karp Search is the slowest for both texts.</li>
    <li>Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt Search is close enough to Booyer-Moore Search for small and big pattern length.</li>
    <li>All algorithms are quite good for small pattern length.</li>
    <li>The results are relevant both for the case when the pattern is present in the text and for the case when the pattern is absent </li>
</ul>
