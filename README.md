# Algorithm Performance Analysis

This script is designed to analyze the performance of search algorithms under different scenarios such as pattern length, pattern presence and text length. It generates a report detailing the time taken by each algorithm for various configurations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- argparse

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Swingyboy/goit-algo-hw-05.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd homework_05
    ```
3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the script with optional arguments:

    ```bash
    python task_3.py --runs 3
    ```

    Optional arguments:
    - `--runs`: Number of runs for each configuration (default: 3)

## Output

The script generates an HTML report (`report.html`) which provides a detailed analysis of algorithm performance for different configurations.
